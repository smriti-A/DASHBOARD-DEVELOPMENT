DESCRIPTION : A dashboard is like a summary of important information presented in one place through key metrics and visuals. In Power BI, users can combine various visuals like charts, tables, and KPIs on a single canvas. This allows them to customize and arrange visuals for a focused view of relevant data, making monitoring and decision-making easier. Dashboards are interactive, letting users drill down into details or apply filters for deeper analysis.

In the banking world, the demand for insightful data analysis is crucial. To meet this need, we're developing a tracking dashboard for a bank using the 'Bank Full Distribution' dataset. This dynamic dashboard aims to provide actionable insights by highlighting two essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): total balance and total campaign. We'll analyze campaign counts by marital status, track monthly changes in total balance, examine campaign performance based on education, and explore shifts in total balance across different job categories. To simplify user experience, we'll add a month slicer feature, making it easy for users to choose specific months. This user-friendly tool will offer the bank a clear view of its performance, helping in better decision-making.
